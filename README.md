I am a web developer comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices. I have built web and mobile applications using technologies like React, React-Native, Expo, Redux, NodeJS, JavaScript, Typescript, Tailwind, and I have working knowledge of database platforms like MongoDB. 

My aim is simply to be the best web developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning continuously. I am a team player with a knack for visual design. I am currently using MERN stack to build web applications.
